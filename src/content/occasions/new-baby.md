## Celebrating New Arrivals with Flowers

New baby flowers celebrate new life, congratulate exhausted but delighted parents, and mark the beginning of a beautiful journey. Unlike other occasions, new baby flowers require special considerations - parents are overwhelmed, space may be limited (especially hospitals), and practical concerns (allergies, strong scents) matter more than usual.

The right flowers show thoughtfulness, respect the challenging early days, and add beauty without creating additional stress for new parents.

## Best Flowers for New Babies

**Gender-Neutral Modern Choices**: White and cream flowers (roses, tulips, lilies) symbolize innocence and new beginnings. Yellow flowers (sunflowers, roses) bring cheerful joy. Pastel mixed bouquets (soft pinks, yellows, creams) create gentle, calming arrangements.

**Traditional Gender-Specific**: Pink roses, carnations, or tulips for baby girls symbolize gentleness and love. Blue is rare in natural flowers - achieved through blue hydrangeas, white flowers with blue ribbons/wrapping for baby boys.

## Important Considerations

**Avoid strong scents** - Skip heavily-scented flowers (stargazer lilies, hyacinths) that overwhelm small rooms or trigger sensitivities.

**Choose low-pollen varieties** - Roses, carnations, and tulips are safer than heavy pollen producers.

**Consider size** - Compact arrangements work better in hospital rooms. Save large bouquets for home deliveries.

**Select long-lasting flowers** - Exhausted parents need hardy flowers (carnations, alstroemeria, roses) requiring minimal maintenance.

## Delivery Strategy and Timing

**Hospital delivery**: ALWAYS verify hospital policies first - many UK hospitals restrict or ban flowers. Call maternity ward directly before ordering.

**Home delivery (recommended)**: No restrictions, more space, parents can enjoy longer. Best timing: 3-7 days after birth when parents are settled.

**Letterbox advantage**: New parents can't always answer doors. Bloom & Wild's letterbox delivery ensures safe arrival during sleep/feeding times.
