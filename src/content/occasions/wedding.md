## Planning Your Wedding Flowers

Wedding flowers set the aesthetic tone and create the romantic atmosphere you envision. From bridal bouquets to ceremony installations and table centerpieces, flowers transform venues and create unforgettable visual moments. Wedding flower costs typically represent 8-10% of total wedding budgets, ranging from £200 for DIY efforts to £5,000+ for luxury designer floristry.

## Wedding Flower Components

**Bridal Party**: Bridal bouquet (£80-£400+) is your most important element, carried all day and featured in countless photos. Bridesmaid bouquets (£30-£100 each) complement the bridal bouquet. Buttonholes and corsages (£8-£25 each) coordinate with bouquets.

**Ceremony**: Aisle flowers (£10-£50 per arrangement), ceremony arch/backdrop (£150-£1,500), and pedestal arrangements (£80-£300 each) frame your vows and create photographic impact.

**Reception**: Table centerpieces (£30-£200 each) are most visible. Top table arrangement (£100-£400) merits special attention. Cake flowers (£30-£100) must be food-safe and pesticide-free.

## Choosing Wedding Flowers

**By Season**: Spring offers peonies (May, £8-£15/stem), tulips, and ranunculus. Summer features garden roses, hydrangeas, and dahlias. Autumn provides dahlias, roses, and berries. Winter showcases amaryllis, anemones, and evergreens.

**By Style**: Classic/traditional uses roses, peonies, and hydrangeas in whites and blush. Rustic/bohemian favors wildflowers and seasonal British blooms. Modern/minimalist prefers single-variety displays. Romantic/garden chooses abundant peonies and garden roses.

## Planning Timeline

Book florists 9-12 months ahead (12-18 months for peak May-September season). Budget typically 8-10% of total wedding costs. DIY approach: £200-£800. Professional florist: £800-£2,500. Designer luxury: £2,500-£10,000+.
