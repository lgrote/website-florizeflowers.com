## Why Give Flowers for Anniversaries?

Anniversary flowers symbolize enduring love, appreciation, and shared journey. Whether celebrating your first year or golden jubilee, flowers convey romance and honor your commitment. A stunning bouquet creates lasting memories, transforms spaces romantically, and expresses emotions that words cannot capture.

## Traditional Anniversary Flowers by Year

Different anniversary years have symbolic flowers:
- **1st**: Carnations (young love)
- **10th**: Daffodils (decade of joy)
- **25th**: Iris (silver anniversary wisdom)
- **50th**: Yellow Roses & Violets (golden anniversary)

Modern couples often choose partner's favorite flowers, wedding bouquet blooms, or seasonal flowers for personal meaning.

## Choosing Anniversary Flowers

**Early Years (1-5)**: Romantic red roses, vibrant tulips, or peonies celebrating young love
**Established Years (6-15)**: Sophisticated orchids, lilies, premium roses showing mature relationship
**Milestone Years (20+)**: Impressive statement arrangements, exotic flowers, luxury presentations honoring decades together

Match your choice to personality - classic romantics love red roses, modern partners prefer contemporary designs, minimalists appreciate single-variety elegance.
