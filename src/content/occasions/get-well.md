## Flowers for Recovery and Healing

Get well flowers provide emotional support during illness, brighten hospital rooms or homes, and offer tangible encouragement when words feel inadequate. Unlike celebratory flowers, they require special consideration - hospital restrictions, patient sensitivities, and practical concerns matter. Thoughtful selection shows genuine care for recipient's comfort and recovery.

## Hospital Policies & Restrictions

Many UK hospitals restrict flowers - ICU and oncology wards often ban them completely. Always call ward first to verify policy. If hospital prohibits flowers, send to patient's home instead.

## Best Flowers for Recovery

**Cheerful Choices**: Bright gerberas (colorful, long-lasting, minimal scent), sunflowers (optimistic, uplifting), colorful mixed bouquets (vibrant, mood-boosting), yellow flowers (friendship, joy)

**Avoid**: Heavily scented flowers (stargazer lilies, hyacinths, freesias), high-pollen varieties, funeral-associated white lilies, overly large arrangements for small hospital rooms

## Delivery Strategies

**Hospital Delivery**: Use Interflora for hospital experience. Order compact arrangements for small rooms. Afternoon delivery (2-5pm) works best. Provide full patient details including ward and room number.

**Home Delivery (Often Better)**: No restrictions, larger arrangements possible, letterbox options available. Send during hospital stay (for return), discharge day, or 1-2 weeks post-discharge when morale dips.

## Etiquette & Timing

**Send After**: Patient is stable, during permitted hospital stay, upon discharge, or during recovery period
**Avoid**: Immediately post-emergency, ICU stays, when family requests privacy, patients with severe allergies
**Who Sends**: Close friends (personal arrangements), family (supportive bouquets), colleagues (group gifts), neighbors (small gestures)

## Budget Guidance

**Budget (£20-£35)**: Letterbox flowers, small bouquets - for acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors
**Mid-Range (£35-£60)**: Hand-tied bouquets, cheerful arrangements - for friends, extended family
**Premium (£60-£100+)**: Large arrangements, flowers with gifts - for immediate family, serious illness
