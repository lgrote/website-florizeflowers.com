## Welcoming Friends to Their New Home

Housewarming flowers celebrate new beginnings and fresh starts while adding beauty and warmth to unfamiliar spaces. Unlike many housewarming gifts, flowers provide immediate beauty that transforms a house into a home from day one.

Moving is exhausting and stressful. Thoughtful housewarming flowers show you care about friends' or family's new chapter while adding much-needed cheer to the chaos of unpacking and settling in.

## Best Flowers for Housewarming

**Potted Plants (Recommended)** - Last for months or years, symbolize growth and new beginnings, require less maintenance during busy settling, and can be planted in gardens or kept as houseplants.

**Orchid Plants** (£30-£60) - Elegant, low-maintenance, blooms 2-3 months. Sophisticated choice for modern homes.

**Herb Gardens** (£20-£35) - Practical and aromatic. Perfect for kitchen windowsills and immediately useful.

**Succulents/Cacti** (£15-£40) - Trendy, low-maintenance, modern aesthetic. Virtually indestructible for all skill levels.

**Indoor Trees** (£40-£100) - Fiddle leaf figs, rubber plants, or olive trees make statement gifts for spacious homes.

**Mixed Bouquets** - Bright, cheerful combinations bring immediate joy. White and green arrangements suit unknown decor styles.

## Choosing Housewarming Flowers

Consider potted plants over cut flowers for housewarming - they last longer and require less immediate attention during busy settling periods. Potted plants create lasting memories while cut flowers provide quick beauty but need constant care.

**Timing**: Move-in day (letterbox delivery only), 3-7 days after move (best timing), or for housewarming parties.

**Style considerations**: Choose neutral colors (white, green, cream) when unsure of decor. Bright, cheerful bouquets suit casual celebrations. Premium potted plants appropriate for first home purchases (£60-£150).
