# Affiliate Disclosure

**Transparency is important to us. Here's how we earn money and why it doesn't affect our reviews.**

## Our Business Model

Florize Flowers earns revenue through affiliate marketing partnerships with flower delivery services. When you click on our links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission from the service provider.

## How Affiliate Commissions Work

Here's what happens when you use our links:

1. You click on a link to a flower delivery service from our website
2. You're taken to the service's website to browse and purchase
3. If you make a purchase, we may earn a small commission
4. **The price you pay is exactly the same** - affiliate commissions don't increase your costs

## Our Affiliate Partners

We have affiliate relationships with many UK flower delivery services, including but not limited to:

- Interflora
- Bloom & Wild
- Prestige Flowers
- Appleyard Flowers
- Flowerbx
- And others featured on our website

## Editorial Independence

**Our affiliate relationships do NOT influence our reviews or rankings.** Here's our commitment:

- **Honest Reviews:** All reviews are based on actual testing and real orders we place ourselves
- **Independent Testing:** We purchase flowers with our own money to test services fairly
- **Objective Rankings:** Services are ranked based on quality, value, and customer experience - not commission rates
- **Full Disclosure:** We clearly mark affiliate links and sponsored content
- **Your Trust Matters:** We only recommend services we would genuinely use ourselves

## Testing Methodology

Our review process is rigorous and independent:

1. **Real Orders:** We place actual orders with each service
2. **Complete Journey:** We test the entire experience from browsing to delivery
3. **Quality Assessment:** We evaluate flower freshness, arrangement quality, and packaging
4. **Service Evaluation:** We assess customer service, delivery reliability, and value for money
5. **Documented Testing:** We photograph deliveries and document our experiences

## Why We Use Affiliate Links

Affiliate commissions allow us to:

- Maintain a completely free service for you
- Continue testing and reviewing new flower delivery services
- Keep our comparison tools and guides up to date
- Invest in comprehensive testing and research

## Your Choice

Using our affiliate links is entirely optional. You can:

- Use our links to support our work at no extra cost to you
- Navigate directly to flower delivery services if you prefer
- Still access all our reviews and comparisons for free either way

## FTC Compliance

This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on affiliate marketing. We believe in complete transparency about how we earn revenue.

## Advertiser Disclosure

Some links on this website are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and purchase a product or service, we may receive a commission. This comes at no additional cost to you, and we only recommend services that we believe provide value to our users.

### Our Promise

We promise to always prioritize your trust over commissions. If a service doesn't meet our quality standards, we won't recommend it - regardless of potential earnings. Your satisfaction and finding the right flower delivery service is our primary goal.
