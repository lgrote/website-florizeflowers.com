**Promotional Timing:** Black Friday offers 20-30% discounts, while post-Valentine's and post-Mother's Day periods see significant price reductions.

**Seasonal Arbitrage:** Purchasing during low-demand periods can save 40-60% compared to peak times.

**Service Selection:** Match service to occasion to optimise both cost and impact.
