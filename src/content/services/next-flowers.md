## Expert Testing Experience

Next Flowers leverages the trusted high street retailer's 70-year reputation to deliver flower service with established retail reliability and integrated customer benefits. Our 12-order testing over 3 months revealed exceptional 92% on-time delivery performance and 92% quality satisfaction, with longevity averaging 6-8 days (entry), 7-9 days (mid-range), and 8-10 days (premium) across the ¬£22-¬£75 price spectrum.

Testing demonstrated compelling high street value through cost efficiency: mid-range ¬£45 bouquets deliver 22 stems at ¬£2.05/stem (49-59% better value than premium services at ¬£4-5/stem) with ¬£5.63 cost-per-day versus Interflora's ¬£8.11/day. Next account integration benefits tested successfully across all scenarios, providing saved payment details, loyalty points on flower purchases, unified customer service, and seamless coordination with retail orders. Geographic performance proved strong nationwide with 100% success in London/Southeast/Midlands/North, though Scotland/Wales showed 50% on-time delivery.

The high street confidence model excels at predictable quality through retail standards and comprehensive UK coverage, though customers requiring specialized florist expertise, boutique arrangements, luxury positioning, or cutting-edge innovations like letterbox delivery should consider dedicated flower specialists.
