# Comparisons
comparisons:
  - competitor: "Prestige Flowers"
    category: "Budget Alternative"
    description: "Interflora commands 40-60% higher prices than Prestige Flowers but delivers superior quality and reliability. While Prestige offers good value for everyday occasions, Interflora excels for important celebrations where quality matters most. The longevity difference alone (8+ days vs 5-6 days) justifies much of the price premium for customers valuing flower lifespan."
  - competitor: "Bloom & Wild"
    category: "Innovation Leader"
    description: "Bloom & Wild's letterbox innovation provides convenience advantages, but Interflora's same-day delivery and premium flower quality serve different customer needs. Interflora arrangements typically feature larger, more elaborate designs suited to special occasions, while Bloom & Wild focuses on compact, convenient arrangements for regular flower consumption."

## Expert Testing Experience

Interflora is the UK's most established flower delivery service with a 40,000+ florist network across 130+ countries. Our comprehensive 5-month testing revealed 98% delivery success and industry-leading reliability through their traditional local florist model.

Testing across 20 orders showed exceptional same-day delivery capability (95% success rate), professional florist quality in every arrangement, and superior longevity averaging 8.5 days versus the 7-day guarantee. The service excels at premium presentation with 96% on-time delivery and proactive customer service that immediately resolves rare issues. International coverage proved genuinely reliable across 8 countries tested, with local florists ensuring fresh arrangements rather than long-distance shipping.

Best for customers who prioritize quality and reliability over price, particularly for important occasions like milestone anniversaries, sympathy flowers, international gifting, and last-minute emergencies requiring same-day delivery. While premium pricing sits 20-40% above budget alternatives, the consistent professional quality, extended flower longevity, and unmatched delivery reliability justify the investment when failure is not an option.
