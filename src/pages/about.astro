            Florize is the UK's most trusted independent flower delivery comparison platform. We help thousands of customers find the perfect flower delivery service for their needs.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To provide honest, unbiased reviews of UK flower delivery services through rigorous real-world testing. We believe every customer deserves to know exactly what they're getting before they buy.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Testing Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike many review sites, we actually order from every service we review. Our testing criteria includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flower freshness and quality on arrival</li>
            <li>Packaging and presentation</li>
            <li>Delivery reliability and timing</li>
            <li>Customer service responsiveness</li>
            <li>Value for money</li>
            <li>Website usability and ordering experience</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
          <p>
            We purchase all test orders with our own money and maintain complete editorial independence. While we may earn affiliate commissions when you make a purchase, this never influences our ratings or recommendations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our reviews are based solely on our actual testing experience and expertise in the flower delivery industry.
