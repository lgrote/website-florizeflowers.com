        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

        <p class="lead">Transparency is important to us. Here's how we earn money and why it doesn't affect our reviews.</p>

        <h2>Our Business Model</h2>
        <p>
          Florize Flowers earns revenue through affiliate marketing partnerships with flower delivery services. When you click on our links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission from the service provider.
        </p>

        <h2>How Affiliate Commissions Work</h2>
        <p>
          Here's what happens when you use our links:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>You click on a link to a flower delivery service from our website</li>
          <li>You're taken to the service's website to browse and purchase</li>
          <li>If you make a purchase, we may earn a small commission</li>
          <li><strong>The price you pay is exactly the same</strong> - affiliate commissions don't increase your costs</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
        <p>
          We have affiliate relationships with many UK flower delivery services, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interflora</li>
          <li>Bloom & Wild</li>
          <li>Prestige Flowers</li>
          <li>Appleyard Flowers</li>
          <li>Flowerbx</li>
          <li>And others featured on our website</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Our affiliate relationships do NOT influence our reviews or rankings.</strong> Here's our commitment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> All reviews are based on actual testing and real orders we place ourselves</li>
          <li><strong>Independent Testing:</strong> We purchase flowers with our own money to test services fairly</li>
          <li><strong>Objective Rankings:</strong> Services are ranked based on quality, value, and customer experience - not commission rates</li>
          <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> We clearly mark affiliate links and sponsored content</li>
          <li><strong>Your Trust Matters:</strong> We only recommend services we would genuinely use ourselves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Our review process is rigorous and independent:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Real Orders:</strong> We place actual orders with each service</li>
          <li><strong>Complete Journey:</strong> We test the entire experience from browsing to delivery</li>
          <li><strong>Quality Assessment:</strong> We evaluate flower freshness, arrangement quality, and packaging</li>
          <li><strong>Service Evaluation:</strong> We assess customer service, delivery reliability, and value for money</li>
          <li><strong>Documented Testing:</strong> We photograph deliveries and document our experiences</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
        <p>
          Affiliate commissions allow us to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a completely free service for you</li>
          <li>Continue testing and reviewing new flower delivery services</li>
          <li>Keep our comparison tools and guides up to date</li>
          <li>Invest in comprehensive testing and research</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choice</h2>
        <p>
          Using our affiliate links is entirely optional. You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use our links to support our work at no extra cost to you</li>
          <li>Navigate directly to flower delivery services if you prefer</li>
          <li>Still access all our reviews and comparisons for free either way</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on affiliate marketing. We believe in complete transparency about how we earn revenue.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertiser Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Some links on this website are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and purchase a product or service, we may receive a commission. This comes at no additional cost to you, and we only recommend services that we believe provide value to our users.
        </p>
