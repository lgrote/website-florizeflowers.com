## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Create the Service Slug

Choose a URL-friendly slug for your service:
- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Keep it simple and memorable
- Example: "Bloom & Wild" ‚Üí `bloom-wild`

### Step 2: Prepare Images

1. **Logo Image:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 500x500px minimum
   - Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) preferred
   - Optimized for web
   - Save to: `/public/images/service-logo-name.jpg`

2. **Hero Image (Optional):**
   - Format: JPG or WebP
   - Recommended size: 1200x600px
   - Can reuse logo if no specific hero image available

### Step 3: Create English Service File

Create file: `src/content/services/en/[service-slug].md`

```yaml

## Main Content

Write your detailed review content here using markdown. This appears below the structured components.

### Section Headers

You can use standard markdown formatting for the main review content.
```

### Step 4: Create German Service File (Optional)

Create file: `src/content/services/de/[service-slug].md`

Use the same structure as the English file but translate all content. Keep the same:
- `base.id` (must match English version)
- `logo_path` and `hero_image` paths
- `affiliate.url` (unless there's a German-specific affiliate link)

### Step 5: Add Affiliate Link to Sanity CMS (Recommended)

While affiliate URLs can be stored directly in the markdown files, it's recommended to manage them through Sanity CMS for easier updates.

1. Log into Sanity Studio (usually at `/studio`)
2. Navigate to "Florize Configuration"
3. Add a new affiliate link with:
   - **Service ID:** `service-slug` (must match the service file name)
   - **Affiliate URL:** Your affiliate/tracking link
   - **Locale:** Leave empty for all languages, or specify `en`/`de` for language-specific links
   - **Notes:** Optional internal notes

**Fallback Chain:**
The system looks for affiliate links in this order:
1. Sanity CMS (locale-aware)
2. `affiliate.url` in the markdown file
3. Internal service page link

## Affiliate Links

### Option 1: Markdown File (Simple)

Add to the service markdown file:
```yaml

  url: "https://affiliate-link.com/?ref=florize"
```

### Option 2: Sanity CMS (Recommended)

Benefits:
- Update all affiliate links from one place
- Language-specific links
- Track which links are active
- Add internal notes

In Sanity Studio:
1. Go to "Florize Configuration"
2. Under "Affiliate Links", add new entry:
   ```
   Service ID: service-slug
   Affiliate URL: https://your-affiliate-link.com
   Locale: (empty for all, or 'en'/'de')
   Notes: (optional internal notes)
   ```

### Testing Affiliate Links

After adding affiliate links, verify:
1. Comparison table "Visit Service" button uses correct link
2. Service page CTA buttons use correct link
3. Links include proper `rel="nofollow sponsored"` attributes

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Service Doesn't Appear in Comparison Table

**Possible causes:**
1. Rating is too low (only top 5 services by rating appear on homepage)
2. File name doesn't match `base.id`
3. Build cache issue - try `npm run build` again
4. Service file has YAML syntax errors

**Solution:** Check console for build errors, verify rating and file naming.

### Images Don't Load

**Possible causes:**
1. Incorrect path in `logo_path` or `hero_image`
2. Image file not in `/public/images/`
3. File name typo
4. Image file permissions

**Solution:** Verify file exists at specified path, check spelling.

### Affiliate Link Not Working

**Possible causes:**
1. Sanity CMS affiliate link not saved
2. Service ID mismatch between markdown and Sanity
3. Fallback to internal link working as designed

**Solution:** Check Sanity Studio, verify service IDs match exactly, test affiliate link URL directly.

### Translation Keys Missing

**Possible causes:**
1. Using translation keys not defined in `src/i18n/translations.ts`
2. Language file incomplete

**Solution:** Check browser console for "Translation key not found" messages, add missing keys to translations file.

### Service Page 404 Error

**Possible causes:**
1. File not in correct language folder (`en/` or `de/`)
2. File extension is not `.md`
3. File name has spaces or special characters

**Solution:** Verify file location and naming convention.
